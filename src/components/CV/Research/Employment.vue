      | Part of the Analysis for Program Analyses (ASPRA) project, under the lead of Prof Filippo Bonchi. We designed a new string diagrammatic language for bimonoidal categories with finite biproducts. We also worked in categorical logic, establishing a connection between cartesian bicategories and certain doctrines, and we investigated categorical tools for the semantics of automata featuring non-determinism and quantitative features. Finally we studied possible connections between coinduction up-to techniques and abstract interpretation.
