    "info": "Rig categories with finite biproducts are categories with two monoidal products, where one is a biproduct and the other distributes over it. In this work we present tape diagrams, a sound and complete diagrammatic language for these categories, that can be intuitively thought as string diagrams of string diagrams. We test the effectiveness of our approach against the positive fragment of Tarski's calculus of relations."
