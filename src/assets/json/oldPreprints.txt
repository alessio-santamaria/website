In this report we present tape diagrams, a sound and complete diagrammatic language for rig categories with finite biproducts, which can be thought intuitively as string diagrams of string diagrams."

    "info": "We study the canonical weak distributive law δ of the powerset monad over the semimodule monad for a certain class of semirings containing, in particular, positive semifields. For this subclass we characterise δ as a convex closure in the free semimodule of a set. Using the abstract theory of weak distributive laws, we compose the powerset and the semimodule monads via δ, obtaining the monad of convex subsets of the free semimodule."
